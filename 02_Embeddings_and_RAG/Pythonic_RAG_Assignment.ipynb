            "Response: The \"Michael Eisner Memorial Weak Executive Problem\" refers to a situation where a CEO or startup founder, who used to personally manage a certain function that brought them success, hires a weak executive to run that same function after they step into the CEO role. This happens because the CEO has difficulty letting go of the function that originally made them successful and wants to remain \"the man\" in that area. As a result, they end up hiring a weak executive to take over, which can lead to poor performance in that area. The term is named after Michael Eisner, the CEO of Disney who had previously been a brilliant TV network executive but, after buying ABC, let the network fall to fourth place. Eisner responded by saying that if he had extra time, he could personally fix ABC, but he did not have that time — illustrating the problem of not delegating strong leadership to that function (Source 1).\n",

            "\n",
            "Based on the available context, several important principles emerge for effective executive leadership and management:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Distinction Between Executives and Managers**  \n",
            "   - Executives possess a **higher degree of latitude** to organize, manage, and influence the company’s direction and outcomes compared to managers. This latitude implies a broader scope of decision-making authority and accountability.  \n",
            "   - Effective executives are not just managers of tasks but are architects of organizational success or failure, implying a strategic mindset beyond day-to-day operations.  \n",
            "   *(Source 1)*\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Balancing Autonomy and Oversight**  \n",
            "   - While it can be tempting to give highly experienced leaders, such as a VP of Engineering, complete autonomy (“just let him go do his thing”), this is considered a **bad idea**.  \n",
            "   - Effective executives respect the expertise of their team leaders but maintain a level of engagement and oversight. This balance ensures that freedom does not lead to misalignment with company goals or standards.  \n",
            "   *(Source 2)*\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Managing Executive Hiring and Promotion Risks**  \n",
            "   - The process of selecting and promoting executives is inherently risky, with about a **50% failure rate** even under good conditions. This highlights the challenge and importance of thorough evaluation and ongoing assessment.  \n",
            "   - Recognizing that mistakes will be made allows executives and boards to build systems for early detection and correction, including the willingness to replace underperforming executives promptly.  \n",
            "   *(Source 3)*\n",
            "\n",
            "**Summary of Actionable Leadership Principles:**  \n",
            "- Recognize the strategic role and autonomy inherent in executive positions but exercise it responsibly.  \n",
            "- Maintain a balance between trusting experienced leaders and providing necessary oversight.  \n",
            "- Approach executive hiring and promotion with rigor, knowing failures are common; build processes for accountability and adjustment.  \n",
            "\n",
            "These principles collectively contribute to leadership effectiveness by ensuring that executives drive success through empowered yet accountable actions, strategic thinking, and prudent management of talent risks.\n",
