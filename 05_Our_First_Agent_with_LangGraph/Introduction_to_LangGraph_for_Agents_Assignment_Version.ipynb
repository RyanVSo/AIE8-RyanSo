    "## Part 1: LangGraph - Building Cyclic Applications with LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph is a tool that leverages LangChain Expression Language to build coordinated multi-actor and stateful applications that includes cyclic behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Cycles?\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, we can think of a cycle in our graph as a more robust and customizable loop. It allows us to keep our application agent-forward while still giving the powerful functionality of traditional loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why LangGraph?\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

    "**How does the model determine which tool to use?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The model determines which tool to use through OpenAI's function calling mechanism. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tool Binding**: When we call `model.bind_tools(tool_belt)`, the model receives metadata about each available tool, including:\n",
    "   - Tool names (e.g., \"tavily_search_results_json\", \"arxiv\")\n",
    "   - Tool descriptions (automatically extracted from docstrings)\n",
    "   - Parameter schemas (what inputs each tool expects)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Context Analysis**: When the model receives a user query, it analyzes the content and context to understand what type of information or action is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Tool Selection Logic**: The model uses its training to match the user's intent with the most appropriate tool(s):\n",
    "   - For web search queries → Tavily Search Results\n",
    "   - For academic paper searches → ArXiv tool\n",
    "   - For multiple information needs → Multiple tools simultaneously\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Function Call Generation**: The model generates structured function calls in its response, including:\n",
    "   - The tool name to invoke\n",
    "   - Appropriate parameters for that tool\n",
    "   - Multiple tools can be called in parallel if needed\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Decision Factors**: The model considers:\n",
    "   - Query keywords and intent\n",
    "   - Tool capabilities and descriptions  \n",
    "   - Context from previous messages in the conversation\n",
    "   - The specific information needed to answer the question\n",
    "\n",
    "This intelligent tool selection allows the agent to automatically choose the right tools for each situation without explicit routing logic.\n"

    "Earlier we used this phrasing:\n",
    "\n",
    "`coordinated multi-actor and stateful applications`\n",
    "\n",
    "So what does that \"stateful\" mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "To put it simply - we want to have some kind of object which we can pass around our application that holds information about what the current situation (state) is. Since our system will be constructed of many parts moving in a coordinated fashion - we want to be able to ensure we have some commonly understood idea of that state.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's think about a simple example to help understand exactly what this means (we'll simplify a great deal to try and clearly communicate what state is doing):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We initialize our state object:\n",
    "  - `{\"messages\" : []}`\n",
    "2. Our user submits a query to our application.\n",
    "  - New State: `HumanMessage(#1)`\n",
    "  - `{\"messages\" : [HumanMessage(#1)}`\n",
    "3. We pass our state object to an Agent node which is able to read the current state. It will use the last `HumanMessage` as input. It gets some kind of output which it will add to the state.\n",
    "  - New State: `AgentMessage(#1, additional_kwargs {\"function_call\" : \"WebSearchTool\"})`\n",
    "  - `{\"messages\" : [HumanMessage(#1), AgentMessage(#1, ...)]}`\n",
    "4. We pass our state object to a \"conditional node\" (more on this later) which reads the last state to determine if we need to use a tool - which it can determine properly because of our provided object!"

    "#### Answer to Question #2:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Is there any specific limit to how many times we can cycle?**\n",
    "\n",
    "No, by default LangGraph does not impose any specific limit on the number of cycles. The graph will continue to cycle as long as the conditional edges direct it to do so. This could potentially lead to infinite loops if not properly controlled.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How could we impose a limit to the number of cycles?**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to impose cycle limits:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **State-Based Counting**: Add a counter to your `AgentState`:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class AgentState(TypedDict):\n",
    "       messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]\n",
    "       cycle_count: int  # Add this field\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Message Length Check** (as shown later in the helpfulness example):\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   if len(state[\"messages\"]) > 10:  # Limit based on message count\n",
    "       return \"END\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Compilation with Recursion Limit**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   graph = workflow.compile(recursion_limit=5)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Time-Based Limits**: Track execution time and stop after a certain duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Custom Logic in Conditional Edges**: Check iteration count in your conditional functions:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def should_continue(state):\n",
    "       if state.get(\"cycle_count\", 0) > MAX_CYCLES:\n",
    "           return \"END\"\n",
    "       # ... other logic\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common approach is using the `recursion_limit` parameter during compilation or tracking cycles through state management.\n"

    "#### Answer to Activity #2:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps the agent took to find information about the \"A Comprehensive Survey of Deep Research\" paper and authors:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Query Processing** (Agent Node):\n",
    "   - Received user request to search ArXiv for the paper and find author information\n",
    "   - Agent decided it needed both ArXiv search and web search capabilities\n",
    "   - Generated two simultaneous tool calls:\n",
    "     - `arxiv` tool with query \"A Comprehensive Survey of Deep Research\"\n",
    "     - `tavily_search_results_json` tool with query \"author of A Comprehensive Survey of Deep Research\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **First Tool Execution** (Action Node):\n",
    "   - **ArXiv Search**: Found the paper \"A Comprehensive Survey of Deep Research: Systems, Methodologies, and Applications\" by Renjun Xu and Jingwen Peng, published June 14, 2025\n",
    "   - **Tavily Search**: Found additional context about the paper and authors from various sources including arXiv links and related publications\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Information Synthesis** (Agent Node):\n",
    "   - Processed results from both tools\n",
    "   - Identified the two main authors: Renjun Xu and Jingwen Peng\n",
    "   - Determined need for additional information about current affiliations\n",
    "   - Generated two more tool calls to search for each author individually\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Second Tool Execution** (Action Node):\n",
    "   - **Search for Renjun Xu**: Found he is a Principal Researcher at Zhejiang University\n",
    "   - **Search for Jingwen Peng**: Found multiple Jingwen Pengs, but identified the relevant one as Director/Lead Data Steward at Liberty Mutual Investments in Boston\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Final Response** (Agent Node):\n",
    "   - Synthesized all gathered information\n",
    "   - Provided comprehensive answer including:\n",
    "     - Paper title and publication date\n",
    "     - Author names\n",
    "     - Current affiliations of both authors\n",
    "   - No additional tool calls needed, so conditional edge directed to END\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features Demonstrated:**\n",
    "- **Parallel Tool Execution**: Agent called multiple tools simultaneously in steps 1 and 3\n",
    "- **Iterative Information Gathering**: Agent recognized when initial results were insufficient\n",
    "- **Context Awareness**: Agent maintained context across multiple cycles to build comprehensive response\n"

    "#### Answer to Question #2:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Is there any specific limit to how many times we can cycle?**\n",
    "\n",
    "No, by default LangGraph does not impose any specific limit on the number of cycles. The graph will continue to cycle as long as the conditional edges direct it to do so. This could potentially lead to infinite loops if not properly controlled.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How could we impose a limit to the number of cycles?**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to impose cycle limits:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **State-Based Counting**: Add a counter to your `AgentState`:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class AgentState(TypedDict):\n",
    "       messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]\n",
    "       cycle_count: int  # Add this field\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Message Length Check** (as shown later in the helpfulness example):\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   if len(state[\"messages\"]) > 10:  # Limit based on message count\n",
    "       return \"END\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Compilation with Recursion Limit**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   graph = workflow.compile(recursion_limit=5)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Time-Based Limits**: Track execution time and stop after a certain duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Custom Logic in Conditional Edges**: Check iteration count in your conditional functions:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def should_continue(state):\n",
    "       if state.get(\"cycle_count\", 0) > MAX_CYCLES:\n",
    "           return \"END\"\n",
    "       # ... other logic\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common approach is using the `recursion_limit` parameter during compilation or tracking cycles through state management.\n"

We analyze more than 80 commercial and\\nnon-commercial implementations that have emerged since 2023, including\\nOpenAI/Deep Research, Gemini/Deep Research, Perplexity/Deep Research, and\\nnumerous open-source alternatives. Through comprehensive examination, we\\npropose a novel hierarchical taxonomy that categorizes systems according to\\nfour fundamental technical dimensions: foundation models and reasoning engines,\\ntool utilization and environmental interaction, task planning and execution\\ncontrol, and knowledge synthesis and output generation. We explore the\\narchitectural patterns, implementation approaches, and domain-specific\\nadaptations that characterize these systems across academic, scientific,\\nbusiness, and educational applications. Our analysis reveals both the\\nsignificant capabilities of current implementations and the technical and\\nethical challenges they present regarding information accuracy, privacy,\\nintellectual property, and accessibility. The survey concludes by identifying\\npromising research directions in advanced reasoning architectures, multimodal\\nintegration, domain specialization, human-AI collaboration, and ecosystem\\nstandardization that will likely shape the future evolution of this\\ntransformative technology. By providing a comprehensive framework for\\nunderstanding Deep Research systems, this survey contributes to both the\\ntheoretical understanding of AI-augmented knowledge work and the practical\\ndevelopment of more capable, responsible, and accessible research technologies.\\nThe paper resources can be viewed at\\nhttps://github.com/scienceaix/deepresearch.\\n\\nPublished: 2021-03-05\\nTitle: A comprehensive survey on point cloud registration\\nAuthors: Xiaoshui Huang, Guofeng Mei, Jian Zhang, Rana Abbas\\nSummary: Registration is a transformation estimation problem between two point clouds,\\nwhich has a unique and critical role in numerous computer vision applications.\\nThe developments of optimization-based methods and deep learning methods have\\nimproved registration robustness and efficiency. Recently, the combinations of\\noptimization-based and deep learning methods have further improved performance.\\nHowever, the connections between optimization-based and deep learning methods\\nare still unclear. Moreover, with the recent development of 3D sensors and 3D\\nreconstruction techniques, a new research direction emerges to align\\ncross-source point clouds. This survey conducts a comprehensive survey,\\nincluding both same-source and cross-source registration methods, and summarize\\nthe connections between optimization-based and deep learning methods, to\\nprovide further research insight. This survey also builds a new benchmark to\\nevaluate the state-of-the-art registration algorithms in solving cross-source\\nchallenges.

    "\n",
    "**Steps the agent took to find information about the \"A Comprehensive Survey of Deep Research\" paper and authors:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Query Processing** (Agent Node):\n",
    "   - Received user request to search ArXiv for the paper and find author information\n",
    "   - Agent decided it needed both ArXiv search and web search capabilities\n",
    "   - Generated two simultaneous tool calls:\n",
    "     - `arxiv` tool with query \"A Comprehensive Survey of Deep Research\"\n",
    "     - `tavily_search_results_json` tool with query \"author of A Comprehensive Survey of Deep Research\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **First Tool Execution** (Action Node):\n",
    "   - **ArXiv Search**: Found the paper \"A Comprehensive Survey of Deep Research: Systems, Methodologies, and Applications\" by Renjun Xu and Jingwen Peng, published June 14, 2025\n",
    "   - **Tavily Search**: Found additional context about the paper and authors from various sources including arXiv links and related publications\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Information Synthesis** (Agent Node):\n",
    "   - Processed results from both tools\n",
    "   - Identified the two main authors: Renjun Xu and Jingwen Peng\n",
    "   - Determined need for additional information about current affiliations\n",
    "   - Generated two more tool calls to search for each author individually\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Second Tool Execution** (Action Node):\n",
    "   - **Search for Renjun Xu**: Found he is a Principal Researcher at Zhejiang University\n",
    "   - **Search for Jingwen Peng**: Found multiple Jingwen Pengs, but identified the relevant one as Director/Lead Data Steward at Liberty Mutual Investments in Boston\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Final Response** (Agent Node):\n",
    "   - Synthesized all gathered information\n",
    "   - Provided comprehensive answer including:\n",
    "     - Paper title and publication date\n",
    "     - Author names\n",
    "     - Current affiliations of both authors\n",
    "   - No additional tool calls needed, so conditional edge directed to END\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features Demonstrated:**\n",
    "- **Parallel Tool Execution**: Agent called multiple tools simultaneously in steps 1 and 3\n",
    "- **Iterative Information Gathering**: Agent recognized when initial results were insufficient\n",
    "- **Context Awareness**: Agent maintained context across multiple cycles to build comprehensive response\n"

    "#### Answer to Question #4:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ways to improve the `must_mention` metric:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current Gaps and Limitations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Exact String Matching Only**: The current implementation uses simple substring matching (`phrase in outputs[\"answer\"]`), which is brittle and can miss semantically equivalent content.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Case Sensitivity**: \"Zhejiang\" vs \"zhejiang\" would be treated differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **No Semantic Understanding**: Won't catch synonyms, abbreviations, or paraphrases (e.g., \"Zhejiang University\" vs \"University of Zhejiang\").\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Binary Scoring**: All-or-nothing approach doesn't account for partial matches or degrees of completeness.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Improvements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Case-Insensitive Matching**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   score = all(phrase.lower() in outputs[\"answer\"].lower() for phrase in required)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Flexible String Matching**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import re\n",
    "   # Allow for word boundaries and variations\n",
    "   score = all(re.search(rf\"\\\\b{re.escape(phrase)}\\\\b\", outputs[\"answer\"], re.IGNORECASE) \n",
    "               for phrase in required)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Semantic Similarity** (using embeddings):\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\n",
    "   \n",
    "   def semantic_must_mention(inputs, outputs, reference_outputs):\n",
    "       model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')\n",
    "       required = reference_outputs.get(\"must_mention\", [])\n",
    "       answer = outputs[\"answer\"]\n",
    "       \n",
    "       scores = []\n",
    "       for phrase in required:\n",
    "           phrase_embedding = model.encode([phrase])\n",
    "           answer_embedding = model.encode([answer])\n",
    "           similarity = cosine_similarity(phrase_embedding, answer_embedding)[0][0]\n",
    "           scores.append(similarity > 0.7)  # Threshold for \"mention\"\n",
    "       \n",
    "       return sum(scores) / len(scores)  # Partial credit\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Weighted Scoring**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def weighted_must_mention(inputs, outputs, reference_outputs):\n",
    "       required = reference_outputs.get(\"must_mention\", [])\n",
    "       weights = reference_outputs.get(\"mention_weights\", [1.0] * len(required))\n",
    "       \n",
    "       total_weight = sum(weights)\n",
    "       achieved_weight = sum(w for phrase, w in zip(required, weights) \n",
    "                           if phrase.lower() in outputs[\"answer\"].lower())\n",
    "       \n",
    "       return achieved_weight / total_weight\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Context-Aware Matching**: Check if the mention appears in relevant context, not just anywhere in the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Fuzzy Matching** for typos and variations:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from fuzzywuzzy import fuzz\n",
    "   \n",
    "   def fuzzy_must_mention(inputs, outputs, reference_outputs):\n",
    "       required = reference_outputs.get(\"must_mention\", [])\n",
    "       answer = outputs[\"answer\"]\n",
    "       \n",
    "       scores = []\n",
    "       for phrase in required:\n",
    "           # Find best fuzzy match in the answer\n",
    "           best_score = max(fuzz.partial_ratio(phrase.lower(), \n",
    "                                             answer[i:i+len(phrase)*2].lower())\n",
    "                          for i in range(len(answer) - len(phrase) + 1))\n",
    "           scores.append(best_score > 80)  # 80% similarity threshold\n",
    "       \n",
    "       return sum(scores) / len(scores)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Most Impactful Improvement**: Combining case-insensitive matching with semantic similarity scoring would provide both precision and flexibility while maintaining interpretability.\n"

Instead of training a model from scratch, which can be resource-intensive and time-consuming, fine-tuning involves taking an existing model that has already learned general features from a large dataset and then further training it on a smaller, task-specific dataset. This process helps the model specialize in the new task while leveraging the knowledge it has already acquired.\n",
